# Games-Mobile-Application

This is a mobile application written in Kotlin, in Android Studio, for the course Mobile Apps Development. 
The project is developed using 4 spirals (currently I am refactoring the code within the spiral 3, in order to add services). 
In spiral 1 intents and button listeners are demonstrated, as well as creation of a suitable layout. 
When it comes to refactoring the spiral 1 into spiral 2, the main focus was on implementing fragments and navigation between them using navigation graph.

This project is now completed, and the final version can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/AHromic1/Final-Games-Mobile-App.git .
